 * interface to implement an object state, such a "DeathState", 
 * "CombatState", etc.  States should be serializable into
 * a String for the state name, and an integer representing the
 * value.  This allows the state to be serialized to the client if 
 * needed.  If the state is server side only, then it is not important.
 * All states should be serializable so they can be stored into 
 * the database along with the object

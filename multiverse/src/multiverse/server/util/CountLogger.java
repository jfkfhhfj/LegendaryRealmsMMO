 * derive from the internal static Counter class.  It runs every n
 * milliseconds, as determined by a constructor argument, and when it
 * runs, it interrogates the registered objects, using methods defined
 * on the Counter class, getting the current count and a string.  It
 * logs a single line every time it runs.  That line contains, for
 * each registered object, the string description of the counter, and
 * the difference between the current count and count during the
 * previous iteration.

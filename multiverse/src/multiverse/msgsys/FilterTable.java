/** Collection of filters with optimized message matching.  Implement a
sub-class to provide custom optimization for certain kinds of filters.
If a filter does not provide a FilterTable, then a {@link DefaultFilterTable}
is used.
<p>
A filter table is used by {@link MessageAgent} to collect filters
together so message matching can be optimized.  Filters are placed
into one of four filter table instances:
<li> send: filters matched when agent sends a message
<li> receive: filter matched when message received from another agent
<li> responder send: filters matched when agent sends an RPC
<li> responder receive: filters matched when RPC received from another agent
<p>
Each {@link Filter} instance can provide FilterTables to use.  If
none are provided (they return 'null'), then a {@link DefaultFilterTable}
is used.

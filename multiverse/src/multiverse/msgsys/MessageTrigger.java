/** Run code on publisher when message matches our subscription.
Sub-class to implement your own behavior.
<p>
Message triggers are associated with a specific subscription.  The
trigger is instantiated (via marshalling) on each publisher.  When
the publisher sends a message matching the subscription, the
subscription's trigger is run.  First, {@link #match} is called
to determine if the trigger should be run.  If match() returns
true, then {@link #trigger trigger()} is run with the message
and matching filter.
<p>
Sub-classes should use Java keyword "transient" for data members
that should not be copied from subscriber to publisher.

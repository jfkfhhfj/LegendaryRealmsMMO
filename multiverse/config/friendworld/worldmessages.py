# This config file defines the catalog of message types used by the
# multiverse system.  All server plugins load this file during startup
# before _any_ message is sent, and thus can agree on the generated
# message numbers.

# Game developers can extend the list of cataloged messages by adding
# to the file config/world_name/worldmessages.py.  The startup script
# multiverse.sh ensures that both mvmessages.py and
# config/world_name/worldmessages.py are read by every plugin before
# any messages are generated

# Create the Multiverse message catalog

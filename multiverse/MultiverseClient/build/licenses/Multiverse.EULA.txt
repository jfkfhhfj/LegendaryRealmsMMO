    CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT.  ALL THE FOREGOING
    DISCLAIMERS ALSO APPLY IN FULL WITH RESPECT TO MULTIVERSE'S LICENSORS,
    SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, CONTRACTORS AND AGENTS.  SOME STATES DO NOT
    ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS
    MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    
6.  Limitation of Remedies and Damages. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER
    NO LEGAL THEORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TORT, CONTRACT,
    NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL MULTIVERSE BE LIABLE
    TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON (I) FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
    OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER OR (II) FOR ANY MATTER
    BEYOND ITS REASONABLE CONTROL. MULTIVERSE'S LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES OF
    ANY KIND WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO
    THE LESSER OF THE TOTAL FEES PAID BY YOU TO MULTIVERSE (IF ANY) OR $10
    (U.S.), EXCEPT WHERE NOT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN WHICH CASE
    MULTIVERSE'S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE MINIMUM AMOUNT
    PERMITTED BY SUCH APPLICABLE LAW.  ALL THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL
    APPLY EVEN IF MULTIVERSE HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.  ALL THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS ALSO APPLY WITH RESPECT TO
    MULTIVERSE'S SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, DISTRIBUTORS, CONTRACTORS AND
    AGENTS.  SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
    INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND
    EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    
7.  Indemnity. You agree that Multiverse and its licensors,
    distributors, contractors and agents shall have no liability
    whatsoever for any use You make of the Software. You shall indemnify
    and hold harmless Multiverse and its licensors, suppliers,
    distributors, contractors and agents from any claims, damages,
    liabilities, costs and fees (including reasonable attorney fees)
    arising from your use of the Software as well as from your failure to
    comply with any term of this Agreement.  To the maximum extent
    permitted by applicable law, You hereby release, and waive all claims
    against, Multiverse and its licensors, suppliers, employees and agents
    from any and all liability for claims, damages (actual and
    consequential), costs and expenses (including litigation costs and
    attorneys' fees) of every kind and nature, arising out of or in any
    way connected with use of the Software.  If you are a California
    resident, you waive your rights under California Civil Code § 1542,
    which states, "A general release does not extend to claims which the
    creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of
    executing the release, which if known by him must have materially
    affected his settlement with the debtor."  Residents of other states
    and nations waive their rights under all analogous laws, statutes or
    regulations.
    
8.  Termination.  This Agreement shall continue until terminated as set
    forth in this section.  You many terminate this Agreement at any
    time. Your rights under this Agreement will terminate automatically
    without notice from Multiverse if You fail to comply with any term(s)
    of this Agreement, including any attempt to transfer a copy of the
    Software to another party except as provided in this Agreement.  Upon
    termination, the Agreement granted hereunder shall terminate and You
    shall immediately discontinue all use of the Software, but the terms
    of this Agreement will otherwise remain in effect.
    
9.  Export Law Assurances.  In connection with the Software, you agree
    to comply with all export laws and restrictions and regulations of the
    Department of Commerce, the United States Department of Treasury
    Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), or other United States or
    foreign agency or authority, and you agree not to export, or allow the
    export or re-export of the Software in violation of any such
    restrictions, laws or regulations. By using the Software, You agree to
    the foregoing and represent and warrant that You are not located in,
    under the control of, or a national or resident of any restricted
    country.

10. Interactive Data Visualization, Inc.  You acknowledge and agree that 
    You are not a third party beneficiary of any agreements between 
    Multiverse and its third party service providers and licensors, 
    including, without limitation, IDV.  You acknowledge and agree that 
    IDV is and shall be a third party beneficiary of this License 
    Agreement. In the event You wish to charge a license or other fee, or 
    benefit commercially or financially in any way from any creation 
    developed using or created with the assistance of the Software and 
    which includes any portion, excerpt, derivative (or otherwise) of 
    SpeedTree, You will license SpeedTree directly from IDV at IDV's then 
    current license fee(s). You understand that Multiverse will provide 
    information necessary for contacting IDV for the purposes of licensing 
    SpeedTree.
    
11. Miscellaneous.  No agency, partnership, joint venture, or
    employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not
    have any authority of any kind to bind Multiverse in any respect
    whatsoever. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any
    right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further
    rights hereunder.  If any provision of this Agreement is found to be
    unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or
    eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement
    shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This
    Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you
    except with Multiverses prior written consent. Multiverse may
    transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement and its rights and
    obligations without consent.  This Agreement shall be governed by and
    construed in accordance with the laws of the state of California, as
    if made within California between two residents thereof, and the
    parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Superior Court of
    San Francisco County and the United States District Court for the
    Northern District of California.  Notwithstanding the foregoing
    sentence, (but without limiting Multiverses right to seek injunctive
    or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction), any
    disputes arising with respect to this Agreement shall be referred to
    an arbitrator affiliated with the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
    Services, Inc. ("JAMS").  The arbitrator shall be selected by joint
    agreement of the parties.  In the event the parties cannot agree on an
    arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the initiating party providing
    the other party with written notice that it plans to seek arbitration,
    the parties shall each select an arbitrator affiliated with JAMS,
    which arbitrators shall jointly select a third such arbitrator to
    resolve the dispute.  The written decision of the arbitrator shall be
    final and binding on the parties.  The arbitration proceeding shall be
    carried on and heard in San Francisco, California using the English
    language and pursuant to the rules of (and administered by) JAMS.  In
    any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the
    prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys'
    fees.  Both parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and
    exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and
    supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements,
    communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter
    of this Agreement and, except as otherwise provided herein, that all
    modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties.
